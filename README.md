For the first addendum, I have developed two games:
1. BlackJack: Compiles and runs as expected.
2. Slot Machine: Gets compiled but needs some improvements to work as expected.

----- How to run? -----
Front end for the project is not developed. So the project can be run as command line application as of now.
To execute run the 'main.java' file under Client package.
Planning to use Swing framework for developing front end.
